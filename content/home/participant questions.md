### **Who contacted me or left me a voice mail?**

You recently used MedStar’s emergency medical services and were contacted by the emergency medical technicians/paramedics at MedStar for an interview.

### **Why was I contacted?**

During MedStar’s response to your emergency call, you were pre-screened for possible elder mistreatment. You may qualify to take part in the DETECT study if you are 65 years of age or older, living in Tarrant County, Texas.

### **What will I be asked to do?**

First, a health and safety interview will be done over the phone. If you agree to take part in the study, you will go on with the interview process. A trained paramedic will visit your home to see if signs of possible mistreatment are present in your physical and/or social surroundings.

### **Will I be compensated for participating?**

Participants who finish a one hour in-person interview with a MedStar community paramedic will be given a $40 gift card.
